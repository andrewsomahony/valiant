Contents of Valiant "doc" folder

ejs directory
-------------
This is a folder that stores a syntax plugin for Visual Studio code, for the EJS
view engine, used by the backend to serve the static layout files (index.ejs, error.ejs).  I'm
putting it here because whenever Visual Studio Code updates, it deletes the folder!  Just copy-and-paste
into the plugins folder.
